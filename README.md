# Advent Of Code Challenge

I am sharing my solutions to the Advent Of Code Challenge in this repo!

## What is AoE?

>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
>
>You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

## Why to do it?

It is a fun experience for the holidays and gives you the chance to learn about new algorithms and features of your favourite programming language. Also it's great to learn from the crazy solutions people came up with! I highly recommend giving it a try!
